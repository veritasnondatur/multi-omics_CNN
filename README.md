### multi-omics_CNN
This repository stores (or rather will store) all code for preparing datasets as well as analyzing of ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and possibly also RNA-seq. Further, these datasets will be analyzed via deep learning, and the code will be provided here as well (CNNs).

# ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analysis of E10.5 hindlimbs
#### This Program serves to load various ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq datasets of E10.5 hindlimbs. Eventually, I want to use this to construct a CNN to analyse co-binding of PBX1, HAND2 and CTCF to various genomic loci
